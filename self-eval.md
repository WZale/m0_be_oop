# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  * It was challenging! There was some definite googling to be done in order to learn how to increment in Ruby, as well as other things. I feel like I have a little bit of a coding hangover after this week, but I do enjoy the rollercoaster-like highs and lows that come with this kind of work.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  * My workflow feels solid when it comes to taking breaks and staying focused. I wish I could complete things a little faster, but I won't beat myself up about it. I think I'm likely faster when collaborating, but I also think that struggling through on my own helps me to fully comprehend new concepts a little bit more. So, there's something to be said for some of each approach, I think.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
  * I feel as though I have a much better handle on methods now as compared to before this exercise. The real trick will be making sure I continue to practice what I have learned before Mod 1 begins, but I definitely feel motivated (as now I know what the workload will be like!)
